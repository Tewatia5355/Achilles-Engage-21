## Why is Achilles different?
- **Extensible** - All features from creating classes and Tests, to evaluating online OMR is built from scratch and with minimal dependencies. Additionally, it's inherits in-built database models of Django. This makes the application highly extensible, i.e features can easily be integrated without worrying about interdependency between components, customization limits.
- **Adaptable** - The code is compartmentalized, i.e it is broken into components. Changing any feature is an efficient process with an assurance that no other component will be impacted directly.
- **Easy Integrations** - Achilles, as a platform, can be integrated into any organization's architecture as a microservice. Credits to the agile way of development.
- **Painless UI** - The UI is built with Bootstrap components, keeping the static files to minimal which greatly increases site loading time, execution time, memory consumption.
- **Hosted** - Hosted on Azure Virtual Machines, Using NGINX (High-performance Web Server). Also uses Git tools for enforcing Agile Methodology.
